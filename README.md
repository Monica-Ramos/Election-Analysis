# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
This project has the purpose of analyzing the election results through the use of python. It seeks to show the total votes, number and percentage of votes per county and candidate, as well as the county with the largest turnout and the winner of the election with its respective votes and winning percentage. 

## Election-Audit Results:

* The total number of votes in the election is 369,711
* The following image shows the results for the total votes and percentage for each county

* The candidate that won the election is Diana DeGette with a total number of 272,892 votes, with a winning percentage of 73.8%. 

## Election- Audit Summary: 
The work accomplished with this project has shown its potential to be used in any election process as it is an efficient method to obtain trustworthy results in a very short amount of time. This script can be easily adapted to data from other elections. For example the most obvious change is to edit the file path and of course the name of the file when oppening and reading the file. Another modification that would need to be made in case that the information does not have the same format(number or order of colums) is to use the appropiate index depending on how the file is constructed. The rest of the code can remain the same, as it is built using lists and dictionaries that use the data on the file to build themselves.
